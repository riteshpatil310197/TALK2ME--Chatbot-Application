# TALK2ME--Chatbot-Application
TALK2ME- Emotion Based Mood Enhancement using Chatbot:

The Project emphasizes on providing solutions to the user based on mood identified during Emotion Recognition. Response generation from chatbot uses concepts 
of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to implement.

# Concepts Used:
Programming Language: Python

Face Recognition

Natural Language Processing

## Haar Cascade Classifier:
I have used pre-trained haar cascade classifier for identifying face of the person sitting in front of webcam.

Haar Cascade Classifier is cascade based classifier which uses ensemble learning(Adaboost) to detect features. Each cascade is responsible for detecting particular feature in frame or image(eye,nose,mouth etc.). Since it uses boosting algorithm, it detects face only if all features in the face(learnt during training) is found in particular region of image or frame of video.
